Program start
The program starts by importing the keyboard library the will be used to log the keys
Datetime library is also imported to include an accurate date and time that the key is recorded when written to the file
Two lists are created, one with the program kill command and the other and empty list to insert the kill command into
The text file that the pressed keys are logged to is opened and set to append mode
The keys are logged using read_hotkey
The first 'if' statement to insert only an 'k' in pos 0 of the 'kill_array' list, so that it is equal and the same as pos 0 of the defined 'kill_command' list
Basically the same thing as the 'if' above, except now taking the pos 1 of the 'kill_array' and making sure its the same as pos 1 of 'kill_command'(i)
Final 'elif' that will make sure pos 3 in 'kill_array' is equal to pos 2 of 'kill_command'(l). As we as deleting any character after pos 2
in the event that there is more then one of the allowed inputs
The final 'if' is to check to see that when 'kill_array' is equal to 'kill_command' that the program breaks and ends
Program end
